Then out of the corner of my eye I saw blood and tears gushing down his face. I looked around the train for someone else to help—maybe someone who works with kids. No one even looked up. So I grabbed some tissues from my backpack, turned to him, and told him to hold it against his chin. He was in shock. I tried to calm him down and told him to go to the nurse’s office when he got to school. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll I could think was: What if that was me? Who would help me? Would everyone stand around like they’re doing now?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when I ran out of tissues to stop this teenager’s bleeding, the people on the train noticed and handed me disinfectant wipes, paper towels, and bandages.
