That’s why these brief connections make us happier. They not only show us that we have a tribe; they also help expand our tribe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we are terrified of talking to strangers. We don’t think we’ll enjoy it. We don’t think we’ll be good at it. We worry we’ll be rejected. This instinct is reified by our increasingly polarized world. We’re funneled into physical and digital places with people similar to us, and we’re told stories about how other tribes are out to hurt us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s a pollyannaish way to conclude this story: We just need to talk to each other—to truly understand each other—in order to melt away our divisions and rebuild trust.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when different groups are surveyed on whether they generally trust the people around them, virtually every marginalized group reports lower levels of trust. The people who have the lowest levels of trust are those who earn the least money and have the least amount of education.
