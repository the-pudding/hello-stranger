That’s why these brief connections make us happier. They not only show us that we have a tribe; they also help expand our tribe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we are terrified of talking to strangers. We don’t think we’ll enjoy it. We don’t think we’ll be good at it. We worry we’ll be rejected. This instinct is reified by our increasingly polarized world.
