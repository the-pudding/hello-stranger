People said they missed going to restaurants, the gym, church, the barbershop, the mall, and sporting events. We could do all of these things at home, and even with small groups of quarantining friends.

That’s why these brief connections make us happier. They not only show us that we have a tribe; they also help expand our tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we are terrified of talking to strangers. We don’t think we’ll enjoy it. We don’t think we’ll be good at it. We worry we’ll be rejected. This instinct is reified by our increasingly polarized world.
